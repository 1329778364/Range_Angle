# Range_Angle

The goal of the situational test is to collect realistic Bluetooth RSSI data between an iPhone and another phone (iPhone or Android) for a period of time at different distances and angles. The phones are carried in different positions during these tests (e.g., hand, pockets) while sitting and standing. 

The distances range from 2-15 feet. At each distance the tester moves in increments of 45 degrees around the beacon phone while maintaining a phone position. 

Testers are to be family/house members who are isolating in the same residence together. Social distancing between non-members should be observed.
